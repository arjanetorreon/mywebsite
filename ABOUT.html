      <p> HEADPHONES WEBSITE <br>
        Headphones are commonly employed in situations in which levels of surrounding noise are high, as in an airplane cockpit, or where a user such as a switchboard operator needs to keep the hands free, or where the listener is moving about or wants to listen without disturbing other people. <br> <br>
        A headphone may be equipped with one earphone or two and may include a miniature microphone, in which case it is called a headset. <br> <br>
        earphone, small loudspeaker held or worn close to the listener’s ear or within the outer ear. <br><br>
        Common forms include the hand-held telephone receiver; the headphone, in which one or two earphones are held in place by a band worn over the head; and the plug earphone, which is inserted in the outer opening of the ear. <br> <br>
        Wireless earbuds have become increasingly popular as consumers move past their wired predecessors. Such earbuds are portable speakers that fit inside people’s ears and connect to any audio-producing device (e.g., a phone or computer) using Bluetooth audio technology. <br> <br>
        Bluetooth technology has become nearly ubiquitous in the technology industry. The technology first appeared on desktop computers and cell phones in 2000 and spread to printers and laptops over the next year. <br><br>
        A headphone may be equipped with one earphone or two and may include a miniature microphone, in which case it is called a headset. For listening to stereophonically reproduced sound, stereo headphones may be used, with separate channels of sound being fed to the two earphones. </p>
